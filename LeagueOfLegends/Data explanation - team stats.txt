All data pulled from OraclesElixir.com.
OraclesElixir is a third party company that gathers data directly from Riot Games, the developers of League of Legends who captured the data directly from the games played.


League of Legends is a real-time strategy game in which 5 players each control a unique character with various abilities.
The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy team's nexus in the center of their base. 
Killing enemy champions, minion and monsters gives you gold and experience and if you are considered "behind" your opponents you gain extra gold and experience upon champion kill or assist.
There are a number of "neutral objectives" on the map which can be killed by either team. The team that lands the death blow on these neutral objectives gains various permanent bonus 
strengths based on the objective killed. These objectives are Rift Herald, Dragons, and Baron.
The map has several towers which defend their allied champions and must be destroyed to access a team's base. Between these towers there is a jungle containing monsters that can be 
killed by either team. 
The map is covered in the fog of war, a blanket of fog that blocks vision and thus preventing knowledge of what is happening outside of the vision radius of allied champions, minions and 
towers. Players may buy wards that grant vision of an area or vision of enemy's invisible wards which can be destroyed.

Your refers to the team represented by the current data point.
