Data pulled from https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/skillcraft which pulled the data from the University of California Irvine's machine learning repository located at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SkillCraft1+Master+Table+Dataset 

This data is taken from replays of 1v1 ranked games of StarCraft II, a real time strategy game in which two or more players compete by accruing resources, building an army and wiping out the enemy. 
A player loses when all of their buildings are destroyed or when they surrender.
Players each start with one base hub and a number of workers located symmetrically on a map. The map is littered with locations containing clusters of minerals and usually gas geysers. 
These are the resources which the players will use to build buildings, construct new technologies and produce armies. 



00 GameID				#
01 LeagueIndex			# Numerical list (1-8) based on categorical rank. Can be considered both categorical and numerical
02 Age				# Age of player
03 HoursPerWeek			# Hours player plays per week
04 TotalHours			# Total hours player has played
05 APM				# Average number of actions per minute (actions are commands given to units or structures)

		# For the next few variables, one must understand control groups. Control groups are hotkeys that a player can assign units to such that when the hotkey is selected, the units and buildings assigned become selected for quick use.
		
06 SelectByHotkeys			# Number of units/buildings selected with hotkeys per timestamp
07 AssignToHotkeys			# Number of units/buildings assigned to control groups per timestamp
08 UniqueHotkeys			# Number of unique hotkeys used per timestamp
09 MinimapAttacks			# Number of times a player uses the minimap to order a unit to attack anything on the way to a location per timestamp
10 MinimapRightClicks		# Number of right clicks on the minimap per timestamp

		# For the next few variables, PACs (Perception Action Cycles) are when a player focuses on a certain area by moving their screen and then makes an action. 
		
11 NumberOfPACs			# Number of PACs per timestamp
12 GapBetweenPACs			# Average number of milliseconds between PACs
13 ActionLatency			# Average time between focusing on an area and making the first action of the current PAC
14 ActionsInPAC			# Average number of actions within a PAC
15 TotalMapExplored		# The amount of the map explored by a player per timestamp
16 WorkersMade			# Number of worker units trained per timestamp
17 UniqueUnitsMade			# Number of unique units made per timestamp
18 ComplexUnitsMade		# Number of units that require direct controls to be effective trained per timestamp
19 ComplexAbilitiesUsed		# Number of times abilities from aforementioned complex units are used per timestamp
